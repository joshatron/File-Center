   * Add editting config page (or to bottom of page)
     * Add uploading cert files for https

   * Add creating directory
   * Add control to restart server possibly
 * Authentication improvements
   * Make more clean and easy to understand
 * Stats improvements
   * Add to run middleware on every request
 * Config improvements
   * If config updated that can't be hot reloaded, restart webapp if not handling other request, or at least notify user
 * File util improvements
   * Move upload code to another file/function
 * Server improvements
   * Need to restructure server file to have much less logic in it
 * UI improvements
   * Admin and index js should be merged to common code where possible
